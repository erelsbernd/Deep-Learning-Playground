The actual number corresponds to the frequency of that word in the entire movie review corpus.

The second number to appear in the review, 1, was the first most common term to appear overall.  \n",

    "Coming into the layer is a matrix of size (`batch_size`, `maxlen`) filled with integers corresponding to the words in each review. The words can also be represented as length-20000 (`max_features`, AKA vocabulary size) one-hot vectors, where a word with frequency value $k$ has a 1 at index $k$ and 0s everywhere else). By changing how the words are represented, we now have an input of size (`batch_size`, `maxlen`, `max_features`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "One-hot vector representations of words are bad because natural vector similarity measures such as inner products do not correspond well to intuitive ideas about how the meanings of the words they represent relate to each other. For example, the inner product of the \"hotel\" vector and the \"motel\" vector is 0, even though the meanings of the words are quite similar. Also, these representations are very high-dimensional.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using this representation directly, we can convert our sparse high-dimensional word vectors into a dense lower-dimensional (for our example, 128) representation which we hope will capture word similarities better. A simple way to do this is to have a 128-by-20000 matrix. Right-multiplying this matrix by a one-hot word vector will result in a length-128 vector which we will now consider to represent the word."
